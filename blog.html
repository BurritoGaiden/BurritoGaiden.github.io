				<h2>The beginning</h2>
				<h3>As a student in AVT 180 at George Mason University, it is required of me to submit blog posts detailing my thoughts and analyses of the readings we are presented by our preofessor in the course. For every blog post on this page, I will try and write a bit about how I feel towards the authors writing as well as how it may effect me as an artist.</h3>

				<h5>http://www.berk-edu.com/VisualStudies/readingList/06b_benjamin-work%20of%20art%20in%20the%20age%20of%20mechanical%20reproduction.pdf
				</h5>
				<h3>This source raises some interesting ideas about the authenticity possessed by original works of art, and the ways in which reproduction alters this authenticity. The author argues that through reproduction, original pieces of art lose their “aura”, or the unique presence they once had. This is an important point to consider, especially in an age when mass reproduction of art has become the norm. However, I do not know if I agree that the reproduction of artwork constitutes a loss of aura. Instead, I would say it leads more to an expanding of its aura, as it is now able to be felt by more people. While it is true that many people may not be experiencing it in its original context, this simply means that it is taking on new meanings as it is viewed in these different contexts. This is something I can keep in mind as people view my art and reproductions of it.

				<h5>http://tmducharme.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ONE-PAGE-Steal-Like-an-Artist.pdf
</h5>
				<h3>This source presents numerous pieces of advice for aspiring artists. I felt that the advice provided here was very valuable, and I plan on utilizing much of it. In particular, the parts which read “You’re ready. Start making stuff” and “Make stuff every day. Fail. Get better” spoke to me. It is entirely too easy for ideas of not being ready/good enough and fear of failure to prevent an artist from doing work. However, unless you can push past these ideas and create something, regardless of how “good” it is, then you will never grow as an artist. In the future I will try to remind myself of this when I am hesitant to start working on a new project.

				<h2>Post 3</h2>
				<h5>http://www.after1968.org/app/webroot/uploads/SimulacraSimulation.pdf</h5>
				<h3>This source discusses the nature of reality versus simulations. The author argues that while in the past creations were always reflections or depictions of what was real, simulations invert this, as they depict a sort different sort of realness that does not have origins in reality as we know it. I had not thought of simulation in these terms before, so this was interesting to me. The ideas in this source are particularly relevant towards art today, as simulation technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Within my own field of video game design, virtual reality is currently emerging as an increasingly accessible feature, so this concept of simulation as a new form of reality will likely have great impact on my future work.

				<h2>Post 4</h2>
				<h5>http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/05/arts/art-view-virtual-reality-is-it-art-yet.html?pagewanted=all


				</h5>
				<h3>This article discusses the emergence of virtual reality as an art form. Because this article was written in 1992, it was interesting reading it from a modern perspective, when virtual reality is beginning to become much more commonplace and is being utilized for both artistic and entertainment purposes. In many ways, virtual reality is new medium in and of itself, and as such its potential has yet to be fully explored, so this source’s discussion of virtual reality as art is still valuable today. As someone going into game design, it is likely that I will be working with virtual reality in the future, and when I do I will consider the ways in which it can utilized as an artistic medium.

				<h2>Post 5</h2>
				<h5>http://www.art21.org/artists
				</h5>
				<h3>This source provides biographical information about many modern artists. Looking through the website, I found information on both artists I had heard of and artists I had not heard of, so I feel that this site could be valuable in expanding my artistic knowledge. As mentioned in one of the other sources, it is beneficial for artists to identify other artists they admire, and then identify who they admired, and so on. In this way, you can expand your influences and find new sources of inspiration for your own art.

				<h2>Post 6</h2>
				<h5>http://www.random-magazine.net/
				</h5>
				<h3>This source has many articles about different types of digital art, such as videos, installations, music, and games. This website exposed me to many forms of art that I had not previously encountered, and as such made me think about just how broad the definition of art can be. By broadening my definition of art, this website can help me to broaden the scope of my own artwork. Aspiring artists can use websites such as this one to draw inspiration from the work of other artists who are using new mediums and creating new and genre-defying art.

				<h5>http://atc.berkeley.edu/201/readings/New%20Media%20Art%20-%20Introduction%20-%20Mark%20Tribe%20-%20Brown%20University%20Wiki.pdf</h5>        
				<h3>When being presented with the definitions and terms that Berkeley’s paper puts forth, it’s very easy to gain a better understanding of the legitimacy of new media art in relation to more traditional, forms like fine art. New Media as is encapsulates a good amount of what is available to those perusing content in media in all forms today. It’s interesting seeing the themes and how inspirations for new media came together to form what it has become today. Being able to appropriate other forms of content and make it your own is what really speaks out to me, and I believe that it is the strongest point of expression for those who choose to work in New Media. The institution is strongest when the audience becomes actively invested in it.

				<h2>Post 8</h2>
				<h5>http://whitney.org/</h5>
				<h3>This source has many different forms of media available on it. From a cursory glance at the website, I can tell that it is very driven by its individual works gaining traction. A user wouldn’t get much information just from looking at the website, but they’re free to explore each little part of the museum piece by piece. The Whitney Museum seems like the perfect bastion of mixed medias for the burgeoning artist in a place like New York, which is full of different artists of different mediums trying to go their own way. One of my favorite parts of the site came from the “learning” section. Although not counting as new media itself, the way the Whitney Museum presents its learning section seems pretty good, especially for those looking to get into art.</h3>

				<p>Hey! My name is Luis and welcome to my Portfolio! I've been making games and programming for 7 years. I've always had a passion for taking small ideas and turning them into successful projects. If you're looking for a programmer or game designer for your project go through any of the contact methods on the left and send me a message! I work in the Unreal 4 Engine and Unity 3D.</p>
				<p>Double Fine, LucasArts, Naughty Dog, and Sucker Punch provide a lot of the inspiration for my work. </p>
				<p>Working on all of my past projects has not only enabled me to learn a lot of cool software, it has also made me a better game designer. Over the past six years I have held multiple positions in which i've had to design lighting and props for live productions and events, as well as games. I use these past work experiences to create environments that are both believable and fun. My motto has always been, "If you want something, work for it 'till you have it." I believe I live that motto thoroughly in my day to day life. The road to success or one's dream job starts with not just thinking, but doing. And part of doing means helping others do. Which is why my schedule is always free to anyone. If you have a game or concept you need help flushing out or optimizing I'm always available to help out so just shoot me a message on whatever social media on method of contact you prefer. And if I'm not available I will make time for you.</p>
				<p>My drive to help others succeed fills me with an energy that lets me do great work and make great games. This willingness to help others is a reason why I feel I can be effective on my own as well as in a group.</p>
				<h1>Stay in Touch!</h1>
				<h2>If you haven't noticed, on the left there are links to my Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook!</h2>
				<p>Follow my game development progress on Twitter. I post screenshots and updates from games I'm currently working on. You can also see retweets of great work by other developers and useful plugins for game dev software.</p>
				<p>Add me on LinkedIn if you'd like to network!</p>
				<p>Shoot me a request on facebook if you just want to get in contact the old fashioned way.</p>

				<h2><a href="files/Luis-Brito-resume-extended.pdf" class="Resume" target="_blank" >Click here to get a copy of my more detailed resume</a></h2>
				<p>​I am currently a student with a very open schedule and am seeking internship and work opportunities. If you have any questions about what software or programming languages I use all answers can be found in the resume.</p>
				<p>Add me on LinkedIn if you'd like to network!</p>

				<!-- Version 2-->
				<!--Hey! My names Luis and I'm a game designer and software developer from the Washington D.C. area.
				I'm currently a third year student at George Mason University studying Computer Science and Computer Game Design.
				Whenever I'm not in class, you can find me leading an International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Chapter as the Chapter Chair, Managing a team of 25 Game Design students as they create a game over the span of an academic year in our Game Analysis and Design Interest Group (GADIG), or Researching Virtual Reality and Games as a medium for teaching and learning about the human experience in Mason's Game Engagement Analysis and Research group (GEAR).
				In the time away from my studies, I work on several projects.
				I have been a game programmer for the past 10 months on the work in progress project "IWAI" being developed by Little Arms Studios.
				I have also been a designer and game programmer for the past year on the game "Blood Alloy" being developed by Suppressive Fire Games LLC.
				In my extra time I have served as a contract programmer on projects like "Wavelength" by AlphaWave Games and "CIV X" by Slawson Gaming in the past 6 months.
				Before I came to University and during my Freshmen year I wore multiple hats as a designer, programmer, and QA analyst for the game "Air Brawl." Air Brawl was the first game I had worked on in a semi professional capacity with a group of developers I had met online. My experience with the project was integral to my game design career experience and it has started me off on a path that can't be stopped!
				While I'm not doing any of the aforementioned activities, I can also be found teaching students in elementary school, high school, and college topics like math, science, programming, and even game design.
				<br></br>
				Get in contact with me through my email, linkedIn, facebook, or twitter in the sidebar.
				I use my twitter to post updates about projects I've worked on and talk with other industry professionals. Feel free to follow me.
