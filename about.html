				<h2></h2>

				Hey! My names Luis and I'm a game designer and software developer from the Washington D.C. area.
				I'm currently a third year student at George Mason University studying Computer Science and Computer Game Design.
				Whenever I'm not in class, you can find me leading an International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Chapter as the Chapter Chair, Managing a team of 25 Game Design students as they create a game over the span of an academic year in our Game Analysis and Design Interest Group (GADIG), or Researching Virtual Reality and Games as a medium for teaching and learning about the human experience in Mason's Game Engagement Analysis and Research group (GEAR).
				In the time away from my studies, I work on several projects.
				I have been a game programmer for the past 10 months on the work in progress project "IWAI" being developed by Little Arms Studios. 
				I have also been a designer and game programmer for the past year on the game "Blood Alloy" being developed by Suppressive Fire Games LLC.
				In my extra time I have served as a contract programmer on projects like "Wavelength" by AlphaWave Games and "CIV X" by Slawson Gaming in the past 6 months.
				Before I came to University and during my Freshmen year I wore multiple hats as a designer, programmer, and QA analyst for the game "Air Brawl." Air Brawl was the first game I had worked on in a semi professional capacity with a group of developers I had met online. My experience with the project was integral to my game design career experience and it has started me off on a path that can't be stopped!
				While I'm not doing any of the aforementioned activities, I can also be found teaching students in elementary school, high school, and college topics like math, science, programming, and even game design.
				<br></br>
				Get in contact with me through my email, linkedIn, facebook, or twitter in the sidebar.
				I use my twitter to post updates about projects I've worked on and talk with other industry professionals. Feel free to follow me.
