				<h2></h2>

				<p>Hey! My name is Luis and welcome to my Portfolio! I've been making games and programming for 7 years. I've always had a passion for taking small ideas and turning them into successful projects. If you're looking for a programmer or game designer for your project go through any of the contact methods on the left and send me a message! I work in the Unreal 4 Engine and Unity 3D.</p>

				<p>Double Fine, LucasArts, Naughty Dog, and Sucker Punch provide a lot of the inspiration for my work. </p>
				
				<p>Working on all of my past projects has not only enabled me to learn a lot of cool software, it has also made me a better game designer. Over the past six years I have held multiple positions in which i've had to design lighting and props for live productions and events, as well as games. I use these past work experiences to create environments that are both believable and fun. My motto has always been, "If you want something, work for it 'till you have it." I believe I live that motto thoroughly in my day to day life. The road to success or one's dream job starts with not just thinking, but doing. And part of doing means helping others do. Which is why my schedule is always free to anyone. If you have a game or concept you need help flushing out or optimizing I'm always available to help out so just shoot me a message on whatever social media on method of contact you prefer. And if I'm not available I will make time for you.</p>
				
				<p>My drive to help others succeed fills me with an energy that lets me do great work and make great games. This willingness to help others is a reason why I feel I can be effective on my own as well as in a group.</p>
				
				<h1>Stay in Touch!</h1>

				<h2>If you haven't noticed, on the left there are links to my Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook!</h2>
				
				<p>Follow my game development progress on Twitter. I post screenshots and updates from games I'm currently working on. You can also see retweets of great work by other developers and useful plugins for game dev software.</p>

				<p>Add me on LinkedIn if you'd like to network!</p>

				<p>Shoot me a request on facebook if you just want to get in contact the old fashioned way.</p>
