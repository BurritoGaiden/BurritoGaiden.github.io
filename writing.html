				GAME 332 RS Final Portfolio Outline
				</h1>
The purpose of preparing the portfolio is for you to reflect on your work this semester and present that work to others in the community.  Construct the identity you hope to portray through the presentation of your work, placing it in the context of your goals and voice as a designer/creator.  The various sections below could be tabs on your website, but you can also include them on a continuous single page.</p>

									Technical Design
									</h3>
</p>
As a designer, one must have a need to educate, inspire, and encourage users to seek out additional
experiences that help them grow in a form that makes sense.
Interactive experiences can take on many forms, and creating iterations of them that cater to specific audiences in tactile ways 
can cause play that can connect with players on deep emotional and psychological levels.
Familiarizing players with the interactive experience using well built mechanics and purposeful world building can introduce them to methods of
creating and feeling that they can take into their work outside of the interactive experience.

<p><h3>
									Design Philosophy V1</h3></p>

I want to design to inspire others. Games as a medium allow players to experience exactly what
the designer creates for them. This means that games can be used for fun, solving problems,
addressing issues, or teaching. My knowledge of game design and computer science help me
create what I think other people with the same common interests as me would want. Studying
multiple subjects allows me to appeal to a broader audience, thus making my games more
effective.
I am designing for the individual who enjoys taking apart things to find out how they work. I
create complex game systems that guide the player in having an enriching experience that they
can grow from. The kinds of games I make are replayable and contain lots of content for added
depth.
Writing wise, I tend to steer towards very specific story archetypes. Heroes conquering inner
demons, saving the land, or fighting injustice usually get written about in my games. The stories
have a lot of further depth that is presented in the mechanics of the games.
I consume a lot of contemporary media. My ideal reading material is usually an opinion piece on
a book, movie, or other creative work. I enjoy seeing how other people felt about specific things
and why they felt those ways. It helps me get a grasp of how other perspectives are viewing the
same things I consume. When I come around to going through something I’ve already read
someone's opinion about, knowing the intended effect greatly improves the experience for me.






<!--
I cannot create games that appeal to every player, but I can use my skills and expertise as a 
game designer and computer science student to design memorable and technically great scenarios in games.
I intend to remind my target audiences of their golden eras in gaming through my work.

I'd like to think I design for the player who enjoys the worlds they play in as much as the characters 
they take control of. The levels and obstacles they interact with should tell a story in their hidden depth.
The worlds should inspire the player to have an eye for design. They don't have to become a game designer.
But I'm hoping they take what they've learned from the experiences I've created and apply them to their own
work.

I'd like the players to take an active role in the worlds that I create. So I try to write characters
that the player will naturally take an interest in. They're not just playing a role, they're living out a vital part of 
a character's life. I try to create this feeling by familiarizing players with the games I make. Pop culture is
an important part of creating that sense of familiarity, and knowing how people feel about pop culture improves on
the desired effect. I enjoy seeing how other people felt about specific things
and why they felt those ways. It helps me get a grasp of how other perspectives are viewing the
same things I consume. When I come around to going through something I’ve already read
someone's opinion about, knowing the intended effect greatly improves the experience for me.

<h2>
Section II   Issues in Game Writing
</h2>
Write a brief statement that describes what you did in this exercise.  What are the strengths of the piece?
Given the fairly loose guidelines, what were the major challenges and how did you overcome them?
Copy and paste your assignment.

<h2>
Section III  Game Narrative Review
</h2>
I chose Stacking as my game to review because of it's unusual setting and unique gameplay. I discovered in the process that when you approach a game 
from a critical standpoint, the rose tinted goggles come off. You're able to see a lot more of the games flaws. But you're also able to greater understand and appreciate the work that went into the finished product.
Thinking about Stacking's narrative enabled me to think of more of the process behind presenting narrative to the player. Trees for decisions the player makes and narrative become more obvious the more you go through and check how each player choice affects the game world. My goal post graduation is to become a Technical Designer. I think I can better achieve that goal by applying the thinking of dialogue being a large branching tree. Understanding the systems behind how things trigger certain events in the game can help me create systems better as well as design them more effectively.

<h2>
 Section IV  Collaborative Story Project
</h2>


<p>I played a sizeable role in putting together the initial concept for the story. We wanted to create a story that had a character we could really write about. </p>
<p>Working in a group was okay. There was a lot of miscommunication in between group members at points. A lot of work that we turned in was not of the best quality
due to group members not leaving others enough time to edit. </p>
<p>If I were to apply lessons to working on a team professionally. I would take a more formal stance on group work. Being able to hold ourselves accountable
would have let us do more for our project.</p>
<p>
Manburger is an interactive choose your own adventure where you play as Jeffrey, a psychopathic food truck operator, as he discovers how to run a business and run away from the authorities. Manburger will feature scenarios where the player will be tested to make difficult choices based on how they can escape the authorities.
</p>
<p>The problem in game writing that I think our story attempts to fix is the writing for games with Text-based systems. Text based games often become predictable and banal. If a designer were to create a game with a circular progression around a certain element of the story. The game would constantly change and the player would be kept on their toes as they go through the story. We fix this by keeping choices in the game set to random, while leaving everything else to be a static hard coded variable.</p>
