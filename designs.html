                    <h4>June 22, 2018</h4>
                
                    I've been contributing to the development of the "Rooftops 2" campaign made in Call of Duty Modern Warfare's Radiant Engine for a bit now. Excited to see the Trailer release for peeps to see.
<br><br>
                
                I've been writing and editing dialogue, jamming on narrative with the team, and scripting dialogue + gameplay events in Engine. Can't wait for this to come out :).

                <h2 style="margin:0px">Counter Strike Global Offensive Custom Mission: "Retribution"</h2>
                
                    <h4>March 16, 2018</h4>
                
                    In December 2017, I began playing around with the idea of creating a custom mission for CS:GO. The idea came from the realization that Counter Strike hasn't had singleplayer content since...2001?
                
                The CSGO distro of Source still very much can handle it, as seen with the Training Course tutorial map made for players.
<br><br>
                I pulled together a small team of myself, another mapper, and another scripter to work on this project. We set our sights on a working demo before GDC 2018 and hit the mark. Lots of scripted events, custom little gameplay tweaks, and tools made allowed us to make a somewhat functional singleplayer map for CSGO.
                
                We had a great time, and got some really good feedback at the conference and during GDC. Will definitely come back to finish the project when we're all free again :).

                    <h4>March 2, 2018</h4>
                
                    After warming myself up with a study on the Leap of Faith mechanic, and how Ubisoft weaved it into their Parkour system, I revisited Assassin's Creed by diving into the Combat System that influenced a lot of other 3rd Person Action titles in the late 20-aughts.

                    <h4>February 17, 2018</h4>
                
                    I've always wanted to get more into the Assassin's Creed series. Not knowing where to start, I decided to analyze the Leap of Faith (haha) to just get things started. Was pretty simple, but used a lot of my technical background to create this hybrid game design/tech design doc.

                    <h4>January 5, 2018</h4>
                
                    Really enjoyed my time spent playing the Titanfall games. Wanted to do a bit of a write-up on a mechanic that sets them apart from some of the other Mech based shooters out there: Rodeo.
                
                    Outside of the actual game, it was quite difficult to find exact numbers for when and where certain abilities and permutations of the Rodeo became available. Had to spend a bit of hands on time with this doc in particular.

                <h2 style="margin:0px">November 2017 Games Career Guide's Game Design Challenge Finalist: <i>Chargers</i></h2>
                
                    <h4>November 28, 2017</h4>
                
                    Wanted to give the "Games Career Guide: Game Design Challenges" a shot. I've always seen them around, but never participated. Till now.
                
                The theme was "To the Skies". I went with something small scope, an air combat racing game similar to F-Zero. Put some basic core mechanics in place with the world limit. Came away feeling pretty pleased with the result!
