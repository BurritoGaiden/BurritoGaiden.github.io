									Technical Design
									</h3>
</p>
As a designer, one must have a need to educate, inspire, and encourage users to seek out additional
experiences that help them grow in a form that makes sense.
Interactive experiences can take on many forms, and creating iterations of them that cater to specific audiences in tactile ways 
can cause play that can connect with players on deep emotional and psychological levels.
Familiarizing players with the interactive experience using well built mechanics and purposeful world building can introduce them to methods of
creating and feeling that they can take into their work outside of the interactive experience.

<p><h3>
									Design Philosophy V1</h3></p>

I want to design to inspire others. Games as a medium allow players to experience exactly what
the designer creates for them. This means that games can be used for fun, solving problems,
addressing issues, or teaching. My knowledge of game design and computer science help me
create what I think other people with the same common interests as me would want. Studying
multiple subjects allows me to appeal to a broader audience, thus making my games more
effective.
I am designing for the individual who enjoys taking apart things to find out how they work. I
create complex game systems that guide the player in having an enriching experience that they
can grow from. The kinds of games I make are replayable and contain lots of content for added
depth.
Writing wise, I tend to steer towards very specific story archetypes. Heroes conquering inner
demons, saving the land, or fighting injustice usually get written about in my games. The stories
have a lot of further depth that is presented in the mechanics of the games.
I consume a lot of contemporary media. My ideal reading material is usually an opinion piece on
a book, movie, or other creative work. I enjoy seeing how other people felt about specific things
and why they felt those ways. It helps me get a grasp of how other perspectives are viewing the
same things I consume. When I come around to going through something I’ve already read
someone's opinion about, knowing the intended effect greatly improves the experience for me.






<!--
I cannot create games that appeal to every player, but I can use my skills and expertise as a 
game designer and computer science student to design memorable and technically great scenarios in games.
I intend to remind my target audiences of their golden eras in gaming through my work.

I'd like to think I design for the player who enjoys the worlds they play in as much as the characters 
they take control of. The levels and obstacles they interact with should tell a story in their hidden depth.
The worlds should inspire the player to have an eye for design. They don't have to become a game designer.
But I'm hoping they take what they've learned from the experiences I've created and apply them to their own
work.

I'd like the players to take an active role in the worlds that I create. So I try to write characters
that the player will naturally take an interest in. They're not just playing a role, they're living out a vital part of 
a character's life. I try to create this feeling by familiarizing players with the games I make. Pop culture is
an important part of creating that sense of familiarity, and knowing how people feel about pop culture improves on
the desired effect. I enjoy seeing how other people felt about specific things
and why they felt those ways. It helps me get a grasp of how other perspectives are viewing the
same things I consume. When I come around to going through something I’ve already read
someone's opinion about, knowing the intended effect greatly improves the experience for me.

<h2>
Section II   Issues in Game Writing
</h2>

<p>
For my issues in game writing exercise, I decided to cover game writers and how the lack of innovative stories in recent game generations can be solved with the diversification of writers' backgrounds. A lot of the more critically acclaimed and classic games' writers didn't come from game writing backgrounds. They were playwrights, creative writers, and screenplay authors. We can benefit from bringing more diversity in terms of writers' perspectives and backgrounds into video game writing.</p>
<p>
I believe the strength of this piece can be attributed to my attention to prominent game writers and world builders. Industry titans like Warren Spector, Hideo Kojima, and many others have strong backgrounds in studying film and cinema. Bringing points into the piece that discuss their real world experience help the reader better understand the argument I bring up in this paper.</p><p>
The major challenges I found when completing this assignment involved finding a topic I was satisfied in covering, and creating a proper statement to frame the paper around. It was difficult trying to find a way to stay unbiased in my writing.

Issues in Games Writer Diversity


The game industry is full of talented and excellent people. Teams are formed all for the purpose of creating a multidisciplinary force that creates interactive pieces of art. One of the most important parts of those teams are the writers. The writers have the duty of collecting all of the information that needs to be told through the game and presenting it in the manner that makes the most sense. If the writer has only written games, the stories that are presented to players may begin sounding the same, especially if they specialize in writing for a specific genre. To better diversify the writing in the game industry, writers can have more diverse writing backgrounds. Providing more education in all forms of media to writers while they’re in school or earlier in their careers can help create this change.

The background of game writers is an issue that needs to be addressed due to how it could shape the game industry in the years to come. Companies and publishers will go after titles that end up having the best potential for monetary success or biggest outpouring of fan support. Big franchises with large budgets have had the privilege of being able to put games out every year, but this trend has led to franchises losing foothold and dropping out of the public spotlight (Daniels, 2015). Some might attribute this to the lack of a changing formula for many series, but it can also be attributed to the lack of writer diversity and familiarity with their series.

If this trend is to continue, we will probably see a more definite shift towards indie games as the modes for delivering intense or innovative storytelling. Bigger companies going with the safer choices in game writing will often hire writers who are more experienced in writing games, as opposed to taking risks with other professional backgrounds. Independent game developers can afford to bring different perspectives to the table because they can work on their own schedules (Kornhaber Brown, 2012). There’s absolutely nothing wrong with having indies constitute a large portion of “innovative” game writing, but games would lose more of their mainstream appeal and we wouldn’t be able to have as many pieces that have that amount of “spectacle” that a good portion of gamers often look for.

For some writers, this might not be too much of a problem. However, this could present an issue for writers who want to expand the way they write and try new things, as they could be met with heavy resistance. In many cases, a writer might be discouraged from changing things up and being innovative with their storytelling (Francis, 2015). The demands and restrictions for a writer are dependent on the project on which they are working, so if bigger companies do not feel compelled to diversify the writing in their games as much, writers might have to take more risks with where they are employed in order to write on games that they feel really speak to them. Holding a job consistently in the industry is tough enough, and if a writer doesn’t have a heavy background in games, they won’t be considered qualified for most roles, even if they have a strong background in other areas, such as TV or film. Different backgrounds like these might aid them in genres involving action, shooters, drama, or adventure, but companies that have the budget to make games like these might also be the least willing to employ writers for these specific kinds of stories.

Neil Druckmann, writer for The Last of Us, is a good example of a successful writer with a diverse background. In college he initially studied criminology, before switching to computer science, and upon first entering the video game industry he worked as a programmer. Druckmann did not begin actually writing for games until his work on the Uncharted series. Prior to writing for The Last of Us, Druckmann also wrote a graphic novel, and took acting classes to gain a better understanding of the voice actors’ perspective (Edge, 2013). Together, Druckmann’s diverse experience helped him to create such a well-written game.

Depending on the players, this could either cause or solve issues. If game writing becomes a less and less diverse professional field, developers might turn to creating new ways of presenting gameplay that make for a more replayable experience. 

Not having diversity in game writing would be bad for the industry as a whole. Eventually ideas get stagnant. The ability to become better designers comes from not only taking in information and knowledge in the form of games, but also from history, pop culture, and art. The more new information we bring into the games industry as a whole, the more we can grow as professionals that work in it.
For non gamers, a lack of diversity in game writing presents a situation that gives the impression of games being banal, pointless, and not worth the time of those who engage in playing them. 

Games as a whole are a difficult medium to grasp. They’re multidisciplinary pieces of art that are meant to evoke emotion or play from players. The genres, modes of storytelling, and stories all play off of the writer’s unique ability to present the story. Increasing the diversity of game writers’ backgrounds can benefit the industry in a way that introduces a better public understanding of games, and a new era of good game storytelling. Convincing companies and teams developing games to work towards this goal will create a better game industry, increase profits, and bring in new fans that are drawn to the already intriguing way that games can tell a story. Better diversity in games writing is one of the best ways the game industry can improve on itself.

<h2>
Section III  Game Narrative Review
</h2>
I chose Stacking as my game to review because of it's unusual setting and unique gameplay. I discovered in the process that when you approach a game 
from a critical standpoint, the rose tinted goggles come off. You're able to see a lot more of the games flaws. But you're also able to greater understand and appreciate the work that went into the finished product.
Thinking about Stacking's narrative enabled me to think of more of the process behind presenting narrative to the player. Trees for decisions the player makes and narrative become more obvious the more you go through and check how each player choice affects the game world. My goal post graduation is to become a Technical Designer. I think I can better achieve that goal by applying the thinking of dialogue being a large branching tree. Understanding the systems behind how things trigger certain events in the game can help me create systems better as well as design them more effectively.

<h2>
 Section IV  Collaborative Story Project
</h2>


<p>I played a sizeable role in putting together the initial concept for the story. We wanted to create a story that had a character we could really write about. </p>
<p>Working in a group was okay. There was a lot of miscommunication in between group members at points. A lot of work that we turned in was not of the best quality
due to group members not leaving others enough time to edit. </p>
<p>If I were to apply lessons to working on a team professionally. I would take a more formal stance on group work. Being able to hold ourselves accountable
would have let us do more for our project.</p>
<p>
Manburger is an interactive choose your own adventure where you play as Jeffrey, a psychopathic food truck operator, as he discovers how to run a business and run away from the authorities. Manburger will feature scenarios where the player will be tested to make difficult choices based on how they can escape the authorities.
</p>
<p>The problem in game writing that I think our story attempts to fix is the writing for games with Text-based systems. Text based games often become predictable and banal. If a designer were to create a game with a circular progression around a certain element of the story. The game would constantly change and the player would be kept on their toes as they go through the story. We fix this by keeping choices in the game set to random, while leaving everything else to be a static hard coded variable.</p>
