				<p>Hey! My name is Luis and welcome to my Portfolio! I've been making games and programming for 7 years. I've always had a passion for taking small ideas and turning them into successful projects. If you're looking for a programmer or game designer for your project go through any of the contact methods on the left and send me a message! I work in the Unreal 4 Engine and Unity 3D.</p>
				<p>Double Fine, LucasArts, Naughty Dog, and Sucker Punch provide a lot of the inspiration for my work. </p>
				<p>Working on all of my past projects has not only enabled me to learn a lot of cool software, it has also made me a better game designer. Over the past six years I have held multiple positions in which i've had to design lighting and props for live productions and events, as well as games. I use these past work experiences to create environments that are both believable and fun. My motto has always been, "If you want something, work for it 'till you have it." I believe I live that motto thoroughly in my day to day life. The road to success or one's dream job starts with not just thinking, but doing. And part of doing means helping others do. Which is why my schedule is always free to anyone. If you have a game or concept you need help flushing out or optimizing I'm always available to help out so just shoot me a message on whatever social media on method of contact you prefer. And if I'm not available I will make time for you.</p>
				<p>My drive to help others succeed fills me with an energy that lets me do great work and make great games. This willingness to help others is a reason why I feel I can be effective on my own as well as in a group.</p>
				<h1>Stay in Touch!</h1>
				<h2>If you haven't noticed, on the left there are links to my Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook!</h2>
				<p>Follow my game development progress on Twitter. I post screenshots and updates from games I'm currently working on. You can also see retweets of great work by other developers and useful plugins for game dev software.</p>
				<p>Add me on LinkedIn if you'd like to network!</p>
				<p>Shoot me a request on facebook if you just want to get in contact the old fashioned way.</p>

				<h2><a href="files/Luis-Brito-resume-extended.pdf" class="Resume" target="_blank" >Click here to get a copy of my more detailed resume</a></h2>
				<p>â€‹I am currently a student with a very open schedule and am seeking internship and work opportunities. If you have any questions about what software or programming languages I use all answers can be found in the resume.</p>
				<p>Add me on LinkedIn if you'd like to network!</p>

				<!-- Version 2-->
				<!--Hey! My names Luis and I'm a game designer and software developer from the Washington D.C. area.
				I'm currently a third year student at George Mason University studying Computer Science and Computer Game Design.
				Whenever I'm not in class, you can find me leading an International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Chapter as the Chapter Chair, Managing a team of 25 Game Design students as they create a game over the span of an academic year in our Game Analysis and Design Interest Group (GADIG), or Researching Virtual Reality and Games as a medium for teaching and learning about the human experience in Mason's Game Engagement Analysis and Research group (GEAR).
				In the time away from my studies, I work on several projects.
				I have been a game programmer for the past 10 months on the work in progress project "IWAI" being developed by Little Arms Studios.
				I have also been a designer and game programmer for the past year on the game "Blood Alloy" being developed by Suppressive Fire Games LLC.
				In my extra time I have served as a contract programmer on projects like "Wavelength" by AlphaWave Games and "CIV X" by Slawson Gaming in the past 6 months.
				Before I came to University and during my Freshmen year I wore multiple hats as a designer, programmer, and QA analyst for the game "Air Brawl." Air Brawl was the first game I had worked on in a semi professional capacity with a group of developers I had met online. My experience with the project was integral to my game design career experience and it has started me off on a path that can't be stopped!
				While I'm not doing any of the aforementioned activities, I can also be found teaching students in elementary school, high school, and college topics like math, science, programming, and even game design.
				<br></br>
				Get in contact with me through my email, linkedIn, facebook, or twitter in the sidebar.
				I use my twitter to post updates about projects I've worked on and talk with other industry professionals. Feel free to follow me.
