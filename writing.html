				GAME 332 RS Final Portfolio Outline
				</h1>
The purpose of preparing the portfolio is for you to reflect on your work this semester and present that work to others in the community.  Construct the identity you hope to portray through the presentation of your work, placing it in the context of your goals and voice as a designer/creator.  The various sections below could be tabs on your website, but you can also include them on a continuous single page.</p>

<p>
In addition to including the work you created this semester, please open each section with a brief reflection that contextualizes the work.  Some questions/prompts are below to guide you.</p>

Suggested Portfolio Outline:

									Technical Design

As a designer, one must have a need to educate, inspire, and encourage users to seek out additional
experiences that help them grow in a form that makes sense.
Interactive experiences can take on many forms, and creating iterations of them that cater to specific audiences in tactile ways 
can cause play that can connect with players on deep emotional and psychological levels.
Familiarizing players with the interactive experience using well built mechanics and purposeful world building can introduce them to methods of
creating and feeling that they can take into their work outside of the interactive experience.

									Design Philosophy V1

I want to design to inspire others. Games as a medium allow players to experience exactly what
the designer creates for them. This means that games can be used for fun, solving problems,
addressing issues, or teaching. My knowledge of game design and computer science help me
create what I think other people with the same common interests as me would want. Studying
multiple subjects allows me to appeal to a broader audience, thus making my games more
effective.
I am designing for the individual who enjoys taking apart things to find out how they work. I
create complex game systems that guide the player in having an enriching experience that they
can grow from. The kinds of games I make are replayable and contain lots of content for added
depth.
Writing wise, I tend to steer towards very specific story archetypes. Heroes conquering inner
demons, saving the land, or fighting injustice usually get written about in my games. The stories
have a lot of further depth that is presented in the mechanics of the games.
I consume a lot of contemporary media. My ideal reading material is usually an opinion piece on
a book, movie, or other creative work. I enjoy seeing how other people felt about specific things
and why they felt those ways. It helps me get a grasp of how other perspectives are viewing the
same things I consume. When I come around to going through something I’ve already read
someone's opinion about, knowing the intended effect greatly improves the experience for me.






<!--
I cannot create games that appeal to every player, but I can use my skills and expertise as a 
game designer and computer science student to design memorable and technically great scenarios in games.
I intend to remind my target audiences of their golden eras in gaming through my work.

I'd like to think I design for the player who enjoys the worlds they play in as much as the characters 
they take control of. The levels and obstacles they interact with should tell a story in their hidden depth.
The worlds should inspire the player to have an eye for design. They don't have to become a game designer.
But I'm hoping they take what they've learned from the experiences I've created and apply them to their own
work.

I'd like the players to take an active role in the worlds that I create. So I try to write characters
that the player will naturally take an interest in. They're not just playing a role, they're living out a vital part of 
a character's life. I try to create this feeling by familiarizing players with the games I make. Pop culture is
an important part of creating that sense of familiarity, and knowing how people feel about pop culture improves on
the desired effect. I enjoy seeing how other people felt about specific things
and why they felt those ways. It helps me get a grasp of how other perspectives are viewing the
same things I consume. When I come around to going through something I’ve already read
someone's opinion about, knowing the intended effect greatly improves the experience for me.

<h2>
Section II   Issues in Game Writing
</h2>
Write a brief statement that describes what you did in this exercise.  What are the strengths of the piece?
Given the fairly loose guidelines, what were the major challenges and how did you overcome them?
Copy and paste your assignment.
 </p>
<p>
<h2>
Section III  Game Narrative Review
</h2>
What game did you choose to review, and why?
What did you discover in the process that you did not expect?
How did thinking about a game’s narrative affect your thinking about story, writing, and/or design?  Can you apply these lessons to your ‘specialty’?
 </p>
<p>
<h2>
 Section IV  Collaborative Story Project
</h2>
NOTE: You need not include all parts of the project, but rather those you feel speak to your role.

What was your role in the creation of this project?  How was the experience of working in a group; what lessons can you apply for working on a team professionally?
Include a brief “30-second” pitch (or the pitch premise document)
What “problem” in game writing does this story attempt to fix?  How does it attempt to fix it?
