				GAME 332 RS Final Portfolio Outline

The purpose of preparing the portfolio is for you to reflect on your work this semester and present that work to others in the community.  Construct the identity you hope to portray through the presentation of your work, placing it in the context of your goals and voice as a designer/creator.  The various sections below could be tabs on your website, but you can also include them on a continuous single page.</p>

<p>
In addition to including the work you created this semester, please open each section with a brief reflection that contextualizes the work.  Some questions/prompts are below to guide you.</p>

Suggested Portfolio Outline:
<p>
<h1>
Section I     Portfolio Introduction / “About Me”
</h1>
Provide a revised statement of 50-100 words, drawing on your design philosophy drafts and any other reflection you choose to share.  Please reference the other works in the portfolio.
Include an image (either of yourself or something you identify with creatively).
Copy and paste your design philosophy drafts (and be sure to date them).
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
<h1>
Section II   Issues in Game Writing
</h1>
Write a brief statement that describes what you did in this exercise.  What are the strengths of the piece?
Given the fairly loose guidelines, what were the major challenges and how did you overcome them?
Copy and paste your assignment.
 </p>
<p>
<h1>
Section III  Game Narrative Review
</h1>
What game did you choose to review, and why?
What did you discover in the process that you did not expect?
How did thinking about a game’s narrative affect your thinking about story, writing, and/or design?  Can you apply these lessons to your ‘specialty’?
 </p>
<p>
<h1>
 Section IV  Collaborative Story Project
</h1>
NOTE: You need not include all parts of the project, but rather those you feel speak to your role.

What was your role in the creation of this project?  How was the experience of working in a group; what lessons can you apply for working on a team professionally?
Include a brief “30-second” pitch (or the pitch premise document)
What “problem” in game writing does this story attempt to fix?  How does it attempt to fix it?
